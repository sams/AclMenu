# Acl Menu Plugin 0.2 - for Cake 2.0

This plugin provides a component for generating menus based on the
current user session and integrates well with the
[AclExtras Plugin](http://github.com/markstory/acl_extras/tree/master) (which Mark Story have updated for Cake 2).
See [mark-story.com for additional info and usage](http://mark-story.com/posts/view/acl-menu-component)

To use the menu once in a *AclMenu* dir on your pluginPaths.

	`var $components = array('AclMenu.Menu');`

When checking out this repo place it into an *AclMenu* directory in one of your plugin paths.
